#### **How was it developed:**
Basically, the app is a whole trasparent canvas that you can draw, created using [FabricJS](http://fabricjs.com).

The main project is just HTML CSS and Javascript, to control the window and handle the events.

To develop the Desktop app, it was used the ElectronJS framework.
