# Screen Drawing Board

### **Makes your screen drawable**
As soon as you are running the app, you can use it to draw with our pen marker in three 4 different colors:

- Red - _Press **R** key shortcut_ 
- Blue - _Press **B** key shortcut_ 
- Green - _Press **G** key shortcut_ 
- Black - _Press **D** key shortcut_ 

_Other shortcuts:_
- To minimize the application press **_ESC_**  key
- To restore the canvas, press **_Alt+F12_** 
- To exit the application, right click in the tray icon and press exit

The application will cover your whole main screen so you can draw anywhere.


#### **How was it developed:**
Basically, the app is a whole trasparent canvas that you can draw, created using [FabricJS](http://fabricjs.com).
The main project is just HTML CSS and JavaScript, to control the window and handle the events.
To develop the Desktop app, it was used the [ElectronJS](https://www.electronjs.org) framework.
